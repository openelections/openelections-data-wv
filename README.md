OpenElections Data West Virginia [![Build Status](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-wv/actions/workflows/format_tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-wv/actions)
=====================

This repository contains CSV files with West Virginia election results converted from [the original PDFs produced by the state](https://sos.wv.gov/elections/Pages/HistElecResults.aspx). The filenames are [constructed according to the specifications described in the OpenElections documentation](http://docs.openelections.net/archive-standardization/).

These CSV files are converted from [original source files](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-wv) from individual counties. You can see [county-specific inventories](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-wv/blob/master/county_matrix.csv) and refer to the below table for overall progress. Elections marked as `done` have all counties completed for that level. Those marked as `working` mean that at least one volunteer is working on this election, and this could be a good place to start if you're new. `Not started` means that this election is wide open and could use a volunteer.
